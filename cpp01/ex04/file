Alexander the Great, also known as Alexander III of Macedon, was born in Pella in 356 BC and is one of history's most famous military leaders. Educated by the philosopher Aristotle, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the young age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.

Alexander is often celebrated for his tactical ingenuity; his most famous battle tactics remain studied in military academies around the world. One of his most significant achievements was the conquest of the Persian Empire, which included the legendary Battle of Issus and the siege of Tyre. Despite his military prowess, Alexander's ambition also led to cultural diffusion. His establishment of the city of Alexandria in Egypt became a flourishing center for Greek culture and trade.
